## Progressive Improvements for Claims Processing  

### **Implementation Approach**  
A step-wise implementation of AI/ML tools is proposed to assist claims adjusters in their workflow. This progressive strategy ensures seamless integration, minimizes disruption, and allows iterative optimization based on performance metrics.

### **Key Recommendations**  

#### **1. Automate Low-Level, Repetitive Tasks**  
- Use AI to handle repetitive, time-consuming tasks such as data parsing, transcription, and extraction.  
- Provide clear, actionable recommendations for claims that require human review.  
- Mitigate fatigue by reducing the burden of manual input.  

#### **2. Enhance Data Extraction and Review**  
- Deploy natural language processing (NLP) techniques to parse incoming claims from email, fax, or phone transcriptions into structured formats.  
- Utilize AI-driven tools to summarize key points for faster decision-making.  

#### **3. Support Fraud Detection**  
- Implement AI models that flag potential fraud patterns for adjuster review.  
- Integrate sentiment analysis to detect tone and anomalies in claims submissions.  

#### **4. Image Recognition for Damage Assessment**  
- Use computer vision to analyze images for vehicle damage, assessing severity and providing baseline grading for adjuster review.  
- Automate framing and detection of vehicles in customer-submitted photos.  

#### **5. Centralized Claims Processing Application**  
- Develop a web-based application that integrates AI tools for a unified, user-friendly experience.  
- Ensure all tools, including data extraction, fraud detection, and image recognition, are accessible within this platform.

### **Goals**  

- Reduce average processing time from **7 hours/claim to 2 hours/claim**.  
- Decrease human errors by **80%** through automated checks and guided workflows.  
- Enhance fraud detection by **25%** using advanced machine learning models.

### **Performance Monitoring Requirements**  

- Establish precise baseline measurements of current process metrics.  
- Evaluate improvements iteratively after each tool integration.  
- Collect feedback from adjusters to refine tools and enhance user experience.
